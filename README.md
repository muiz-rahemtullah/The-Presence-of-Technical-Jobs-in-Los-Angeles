# The-Presence-of-Technical-Jobs-in-Los-Angeles

In the second part of this project we examine the portion of technical jobs in the Los Angeles Area, broken down by Zip Code. 
The data file used initially contains NA values and so we must clean the data before obtaining results and making a valid 
conclusion.
